easy
-format user joined date date
-add generic error page and add try catches to every view (how to do this with minimal code)
-link to user profiles potentially and make profile page (change profile template to work for any user) have a profiles page in live and a myprofile page in auth

hide video link on individual video view page (you can just keep clicking it in a nested navigation to the video)
handle wierd aspect ratios?? video uploads
responsive breakpoints makes parkour video shrink really small
change like functionalty to redirect to request.resend or whatever it is

for all routes that use parameters, make sure that random users can't access stuff they aren't supposed to
for all routes that use parameters, make sure that there is a proper error page if you type in a bogus parameters
    validate parameters are correct data type


double check all routes are login only and non-logged in users can't access anything important

maybe add profile descriptions
