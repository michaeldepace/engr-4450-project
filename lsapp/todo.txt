END
-foolproof all required form inputs on serverside
-double check all routes are login only and non-logged in users can't access anything important
-deploy to heroku and stress test
-clean up code and comment
-remove duplicate and test users and add new test users
--for all routes that use parameters, make sure that random users can't access stuff they aren't supposed to
--for all routes that use parameters, make sure that there is a proper error page if you type in a bogus parameters
    validate parameters are correct data type
